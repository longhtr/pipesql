# Work plan

[README](../README.md) owns product requirements and decision order;
[Engineering](../docs/engineering.md) owns working method. This plan identifies
unfinished work and publication restrictions. [Evidence](evidence.md) owns
completed investigations, verification results and consequential limitations.

## Current baseline

The complete 24-stage gates for `5697961` pass on matching frozen macOS and GNU
arm64 Linux inputs: 539 ordinary Rust tests per platform and 311 composition
cases, plus the applicable allocation and native campaigns. The
[checkpoint](evidence.md#full-verification-checkpoint) records exact inputs,
controls and limits. Linux retains two Darwin ACL exclusions. The
[platform matrix](../docs/testing.md#platform-status) distinguishes implementation,
execution and qualification; a passing gate does not establish release readiness.

Use the [language manifest](../docs/language.md#current-public-query-manifest),
[implementation reading path](../docs/README.md#learn-the-implementation),
[test map](../tests/README.md) and [tool map](../tools/README.md) for current
capabilities and commands. Maintained checks need no historical checkout or
archive. Completed milestones remain closed unless a concrete defect, affected
boundary or new workload changes their disposition. The
[testing/tooling review](evidence.md#testing-and-tooling-cleanup) retains its
coverage inventory and consequential deletion rationale.

## Current: analytic allocation ownership

The bounded analytic count implementation and both complete gates are retained
in `5697961`; its [checkpoint](evidence.md#full-partition-analytic-count) records
results and integration repairs. Independently measure this new public workload's
allocation ownership before changing its execution strategy.

1. Trace preparation, sorted-input construction, capture, spill, emission, replay
   and release. Reuse the existing composed-ownership caller and runner. Keep
   measurement scaffolding outside observed intervals and derive explicit
   nonheap allowances from their contracts.
2. Add a finite workload set covering count-only and repeated counts, typed
   spilled rows and composition. Check literal expected rows, requested/usable
   extents, public owner sums and complete release. Exercise both pathname
   lengths and an attribution negative control.
3. Reproduce any discrepancy on current inputs and repair its responsible owner
   without allowance inflation or weaker equations. Preserve demanded errors,
   independent validators, bounded work, cancellation, failure and cleanup.
4. Run the complete ownership selection on macOS and native-storage GNU/Linux,
   plus affected tooling checks. Engine changes require both complete frozen
   gates. Update navigation and concise evidence, remove owned artifacts and
   commit verified changes locally.

The existing caller now contains seven analytic cases. Preparation attribution
and admission/first-spill/emission/terminal equations pass the focused macOS
probe, with requested/usable samples after every step and complete release.
The parser's 160-token bound admits nineteen repeated calls; twenty reject.
No engine discrepancy has been observed. Complete ownership selections on both
platforms, tooling interpretation checks, documentation and final cleanup remain.

## Next engineering priorities

Choose the next bounded milestone by README's decision order. Resolve a concrete
semantic, durability or resource counterexample before extending the affected
owner. The existing append, reader and grouped-allocation repairs remain complete;
the physical-memory qualifications below are broader obligations.

| Area | Next action and required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Resource ownership | Identify an uncovered owner, allocation history or transient boundary with a representative public workload. Trace any requested/usable/charged discrepancy before changing admission. Preserve independent attribution and release checks; arbitrary allocators and whole-process/RSS bounds remain unqualified. |
| Native platforms | Implement the missing Windows paths, handles, traversal, locking, synchronization, CLI startup and process ownership in bounded owner-specific changes. Separate compilation from native runtime qualification; unavailable Windows hardware must not block independent macOS/GNU/Linux work. |
| Filesystems and durability | Qualify additional supported filesystem/device premises beyond process termination. Keep the tested host-shared mount excluded and identity checks fail-closed. Reopen its unresolved sharing-layer cause only when new environment evidence can change the disposition. The [identity diagnostic](../docs/testing.md#diagnose-filesystem-identity) is independently replayable. |
| Native diagnostics | Extend from qualified mutex/pathname Rust wrappers to an affected unqualified boundary with reproducible clean/fault controls. ThreadSanitizer, instrumented standard libraries, system-library internals, other native boundaries and general race freedom remain unfinished. See the [qualification limits](evidence.md#platform-and-sanitizer-limitations). |
| Product qualification | Select a useful bounded language/workload or crash/concurrency scenario from the intended analytical workload. Preserve independent result, failure and resource oracles. Deterministic overlapping-reader schedules do not establish arbitrary-race detection. Measure complete-query costs before changing an owner for performance; define compatibility before promising stable formats or interfaces. |

The shared-mount investigation found descriptor APIs agreeing and no repository
normalization defect. Native storage passed while the tested sharing layer did
not; the causal question remains unresolved. Linux campaigns use an unprivileged
user and native database storage. Broader durability, Windows runtime and
whole-process memory require separate evidence.

Partitioned hash aggregation, a shared buffer manager and parallel execution
remain possible alternatives, not scheduled rewrites. Investigate one when a
representative workload exposes a concrete limitation, with an independent
correctness oracle, resource costs and an end-to-end measurement that can reject
the proposal. The [grouping workload record](evidence.md#grouping-learning-workload)
retains the adopted research lessons and oracle-compatibility caveat.

## Publication

Review the exact tree and destination before publishing. Do not push, publish,
modify remote refs or rewrite published history until the publication decision
is explicitly resolved. Any later history replacement requires explicit
authorization and reconciliation of the actual remote state.
